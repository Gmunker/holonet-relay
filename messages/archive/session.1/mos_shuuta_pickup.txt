------
fyi - teemo just sent notice that there will be an extra 5 to pick up on mos shuuta. don’t know the story but he’s eager to dump this lot which means a better cut for us. there’s another item from Ryloth in the bunch so don’t confuse it with the other 4, haha!

you can sell the extras anywhere, standard split. 4 other items come home as discussed. i think krayt has capacity for this, but if not, lose an extra before hyper.
