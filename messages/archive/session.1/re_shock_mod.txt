Mr. Trex:

Responses inline.

>> okay, while i still want you to try the shock bullet idea, if thats redicilous i am fine with a shock bayonet.

Non-lethal long-range shock bullets would be quite the trick, I just can’t think of a way to make that work. I can recommend a few models of sonic rifle for that need. Instead, we’ll begin work on an under-rifle shock bayonet that will work nicely when you want incapacitation at short range.

>> next job is bringing in quite a bit extra and i expect to be there in a few weeks time to settle up.

Not to worry, your advance covers the initial work. We’ll see you soon.

We value your business.
