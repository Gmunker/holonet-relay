------
Be advised that due to the high level of interest through the sector in the funeral of Baron Jaa Halcorr tomorrow, docking and undocking at Centerpoint may take as long as 8-10 hours and may require a congestion surcharge on dockage fees. Departures who can complete all preliminary questionnaire questions will be given higher departure priority.

Thank you in advance for your patience.
