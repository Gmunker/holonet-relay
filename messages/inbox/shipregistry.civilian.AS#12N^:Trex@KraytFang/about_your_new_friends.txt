subject: About Your New Friends
------
Khron - your newfound friends brought their troubles to Arkanis for you to share. The individual called Trex, the previous owner of the “Krayt Fang,” is far more dangerous than any of you realize. Trex is a player in a some kind of new criminal organization. I don’t have much on this group but for a track record of cleaning up loose ends by any means necessary. These people take “guilt by association” to its logical extreme.

I need you to keep Trex and the rest of your new friends alive long enough for us to meet. I’ve read about you and your past - I know things didn’t go well when you last had to protect someone. This is a chance at redemption, a chance to set the record straight about who you really are.

Come to Cloud City and we can figure out the next move. Anything less than a face-to-face meeting would put me at too much risk; I’m taking  a chance just sending this message. When you get here, go about taking some R&R just like any other spacers visiting Cloud City. I’ll find you.

Safe travels.
